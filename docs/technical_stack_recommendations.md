Backend Architecture
Primary Choice: Node.js with Express/Fastify

Why: Excellent ecosystem for rapid development, great for APIs, strong OAuth integration support
Alternative: Python with FastAPI (if team prefers Python, excellent for data processing and ML for insurance optimization)

Database Strategy:

PostgreSQL as primary database (ACID compliance crucial for financial data)
Redis for caching and session management
S3-compatible storage for document management

Frontend Architecture
React with Next.js

Why:

Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
Built-in API routes
Excellent mobile responsiveness
Strong ecosystem for complex UI components


UI Library: Material-UI or Chakra UI for consistent design
State Management: Zustand or Redux Toolkit

Mobile Strategy
React Native with Expo

Why: Code sharing with web frontend, rapid development, excellent for notifications
Alternative: Flutter (if team prefers Dart, excellent performance)

Authentication & Authorization
Auth0 or Supabase Auth

Built-in OAuth providers (Facebook, Google)
Easy IAS integration
Role-based access control
Iceland-specific compliance features

Payment & Financial
Stripe Connect

Perfect for marketplace commission model
Handles complex payment flows
Strong fraud protection
Easy Iceland banking integration

Communication & Notifications
Twilio for SMS
SendGrid for email
Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications
Socket.io for real-time in-app communication
Document Management
AWS S3 + CloudFront or Supabase Storage

Scalable file storage
CDN for fast document delivery
Version control for important documents

Meeting & Calendar
Integration approach:

Google Calendar API for calendar management
Zoom SDK or Jitsi Meet for video meetings
Custom voting system using WebSockets

DevOps & Infrastructure
Docker + Kubernetes or Vercel/Netlify

Development: Docker for local development
Production: Kubernetes on cloud provider or serverless with Vercel
Database: Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
Monitoring: Sentry for error tracking, DataDog for performance

Integration Considerations
HMS (Housing Authority) Integration:

REST API wrapper with proper error handling
Background job processing (Bull Queue with Redis)
Data synchronization strategies

Why This Stack?

Rapid Development: Modern frameworks allow quick MVP delivery
Scalability: Can handle growth from small HAs to nationwide deployment
Compliance: PostgreSQL + proper auth handles financial regulations
Maintenance: Well-documented, widely-adopted technologies
Team Adoption: Popular stack with good developer availability in Iceland
Cost Efficiency: Mix of managed services and open-source tools

Alternative Considerations
If prioritizing performance over development speed:

Backend: Go with Gin or Rust with Actix-web
Frontend: SvelteKit for smaller bundle sizes

If team has .NET expertise:

Backend: .NET Core with Entity Framework
Frontend: Blazor Server or React

The recommended stack balances development velocity, maintainability, and the specific needs of a fintech-adjacent system handling sensitive housing association data.
